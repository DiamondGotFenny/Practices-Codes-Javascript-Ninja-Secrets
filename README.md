# Practices-Codes-Javascript-Ninja-Secrets

Those are my coding practices when reading the book The Secrets of the Javascript Ninja.

I created three functions: assert, report and fail for displaying code output in the html. 

they are not 100% copied from the book, I altered some of codes, they are clearer for me when i review them. 

and it is just fun to rewrite those code and do it my way when i was coding.
